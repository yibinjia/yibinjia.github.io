At the age of ten, I was introduced to my first video game, CS1.6. From then on, I became obsessed with it and joined the gaming community. I spent countless joyful moments in the game and made many friends. However, as I grew older, the pressures of real life made me realize that the video game had consumed TOO MUCH of my time!

I told myself from that point on, I'd never waste time on games again.

Yet of course, fate had its way with me...

After that, I entered Jilin University, a great university that offers the opportunity to engage in various activities. We created educational software for power plant workers, joined drone and robot design competitions, and competed in the Asia-Pacific University Mathematics Competition. While some results were successful, many were frustrating. Still, I saw these experiences as valuable lessons, teaching me how to study and stay patient in different situations.

After graduating, I successfully secured a job in web development, but I felt that I was stagnant.

I decided to quit my job and reached out to my graduate advisor, [Professor Xiangshi Ren](https://xiangshiren.com/), an expert in HCI. He guided me through my undergraduate thesis and introduced me to game research. During my two years at the CHEC lab, I built strong friendships with my colleagues. We played, studied, and discussed games (sometimes debating). Influenced by my professor and colleagues, I completed my master's thesis on perceived difficulty in games. The journey wasn’t always smooth, but unlike merely watching the sea from the shore, I could now dive in and explore—though occasionally hitting some rocks.

After graduating again, I’m motivated to move forward, aiming to use video games as an educational tool to make the world more peaceful and fun. In 2024, I developed a roguelike game for waste sorting, and in 2025, I’m working on a game for learning foreign languages. I also plan to apply for a PhD in game research. 

Although this is a challenge, I will move towards it, day by day, step by step.

I have no idea what the future holds, but you better believe I'll make the best of it. Thanks for reading.
