Proper waste management is essential for tackling environmental, social, and economic issues, yet effective waste sorting remains a challenge due to citizens’ limited knowledge and varying local regulations. Traditional educational methods often fail to engage users, particularly newcomers. To address this, we present ”The World of Trash”, a serious game designed to educate players on waste sorting across diverse regions. The game leverages Roguelike mechanics, emphasizing map exploration and
high replayability, to enhance players’ engagement in learning about cross-regional waste sorting. We also discuss the game’s application scenarios and expected outcomes. Ultimately, our goal is to contribute to global waste management through this
innovative educational tool.  

## Future Work  

- Implement additional features: map system and recycling system
- Design and experiment to verify if this game enhances the engagement and experience
